# WhereAmI
Geography game coded with Python and Tkinter.
What do you have to do?
- place your marker as close as you can to the target location
- you can get up to two hint (as of right now both hints are displayed at the same time)
- beat your current highscore

Game is a working project to get better at coding and just to have fun. 
Still buggy and the features to start a game need to be implemented. As of right now, it is in endless mode.
